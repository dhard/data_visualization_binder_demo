[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dhard/data_visualization_binder_demo/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

Uses a Git repository to set up a binder that can run R code with RStudio on
the browser via [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) or any JupyterHub (such as UC Merced's 2i2c hub).

Based on the [rocker/geospatial](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial)
image.
